Example Commands/Setup:

The following commands should give you the majority if not all of what you need:

# Get the cli and make it available to use.
wget http://127.0.0.1:15672/cli/rabbitmqadmin
chmod +x rabbitmqadmin
mv rabbitmqadmin /etc/rabbitmq
Add a user and permissions

rabbitmqctl add_user testuser testpassword
rabbitmqctl set_user_tags testuser administrator
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / testuser ".*" ".*" ".*"
Make a virtual host and Set Permissions

rabbitmqctl add_vhost Some_Virtual_Host
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p Some_Virtual_Host guest ".*" ".*" ".*"
Make an Exchange

./rabbitmqadmin declare exchange --vhost=Some_Virtual_Host name=some_exchange type=direct
Make a Queue

./rabbitmqadmin declare queue --vhost=Some_Virtual_Host name=some_outgoing_queue durable=true
Make a Binding

./rabbitmqadmin --vhost="Some_Virtual_Host" declare binding source="some_exchange" destination_type="queue" destination="some_incoming_queue" routing_key="some_routing_key"
Alternative Way to Bind with Python

The following is an alternative to command line binding, as I've had issues with it sometimes and found the following python code to be more reliable.

#!/usr/bin/env python
import pika

rabbitmq_host = "127.0.0.1"
rabbitmq_port = 5672
rabbitmq_virtual_host = "Some_Virtual_Host"
rabbitmq_send_exchange = "some_exchange" 
rabbitmq_rcv_exchange = "some_exchange"
rabbitmq_rcv_queue = "some_incoming_queue"
rabbitmq_rcv_key = "some_routing_key"

outgoingRoutingKeys = ["outgoing_routing_key"]
outgoingQueues = ["some_outgoing_queue "]

# The binding area
credentials = pika.PlainCredentials(rabbitmq_user, rabbitmq_password)
connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(rabbitmq_host, rabbitmq_port, rabbitmq_virtual_host, credentials))
channel = connection.channel()
channel.queue_bind(exchange=rabbitmq_rcv_exchange, queue=rabbitmq_rcv_queue, routing_key=rabbitmq_rcv_key)

for index in range(len(outgoingRoutingKeys)):
    channel.queue_bind(exchange=rabbitmq_send_exchange, queue=outgoingQueues[index], routing_key=out
